        /* 
        First Part of the recursion method
        You need to remember that you won’t have just one call, you’ll have several nested calls.
        
        Calls:
        
        Each call: num === "?"        	         num * factorialize(num - 1)
        1st call – factorialize(5) will return    5  * factorialize(5 - 1) // factorialize(4)
        2nd call – factorialize(4) will return    4  * factorialize(4 - 1) // factorialize(3)
        3rd call – factorialize(3) will return    3  * factorialize(3 - 1) // factorialize(2)
        4th call – factorialize(2) will return    2  * factorialize(2 - 1) // factorialize(1)
        5th call – factorialize(1) will return    1  * factorialize(1 - 1) // factorialize(0)
        
        Second part of the recursion method
        The method hits the if condition and returns 1, which is multiplied with num.
        
        Call Returns:
                                                 num
        5th call – factorialize(1) will return    1  * factorialize(1 - 1) 
            factorialize(1 - 1) = factorialize(0) which returns 1 (hits the if condition)
            So 5th call returns 1 * 1 = 1
            
        4th call – factorialize(2) will return    2  * factorialize(2 - 1) 
            factorialize(2 - 1) = factorialize(1) which returns 1
            So 4th call returns 2 * 1 = 2
            
        3rd call – factorialize(3) will return    3  * factorialize(3 - 1) 
            factorialize(3 - 1) = factorialize(2) which returns 2
            So 3rd call returns 3 * 2 = 6
            
        2nd call – factorialize(4) will return    4  * factorialize(4 - 1) 
            factorialize(4 - 1) = factorialize(3) which returns 6
            So 2nd call returns 4 * 6 = 24
            
        1st call – factorialize(5) will return    5  * factorialize(5 - 1) 
            factorialize(5 - 1) = factorialize(4) which returns 24
            So 1st call returns 5 * 24 = 120
