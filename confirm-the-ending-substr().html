Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).

Difference between substring() and substr()

There's a subtle difference between the substring() and substr() methods, and you should be careful not get them confused.

Where the arguments of the substring() method represent the starting and ending indexes, the arguments of 
substr() method represent the starting index and the length of characters to include in the resulting string.
_________________________________________

With only a single 'start' argument, substring() works the same as substr().

<script>

function confirmEnding(str, target) {
 
 // Get length of target
 var targetLength = target.length;
 var stringLength = str.length;
 // Extract sub-string of chars from end of str that is length of target
 var subString = str.substr(stringLength - targetLength); 
 // Compare target and sub-string 
 if (target === subString) {
     return true;
 }
 return false;
}
    
/* Refactored */
    
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  var subString = str.substr(str.length - target.length); 
  return target === subString;
}
    
/* 
stringLength - targetLength
    7        -     1       = 6
So str.substr(stringLength - targetLength) returns the 6th character (index starts at 0), which is 'n'.
If only a single index parameter (as in this case) the rest of the string from this 'start' index is extracted. Which is why substring is returned 'n' rather than 'Bastia'.

//confirmEnding("Bastian", "n") 
//confirmEnding("Connor", "n") 
//confirmEnding("Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen", "specification") 
//confirmEnding("He has to give me a new name", "name") 
//confirmEnding("Open sesame", "same") 
confirmEnding("Open sesame", "pen") 
//confirmEnding("If you want to save our world, you must hurry. We dont know how much longer we can withstand the nothing", "mountain")
